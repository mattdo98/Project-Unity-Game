# Project-Unity-Game

Code for my COP3003 class, I will be making a unity game following the tutorial found here https://learn.unity.com/project/tanks-tutorial

I will update this weekly or when I finish a section. And will post the code as I progress.

Week 1: downloaded the prefabs and set up the level where the game will be played, I also configured the color and lighting along with the camera direction so only the level will be shown in scale. Next week I will be focusing on creating the tanks.
